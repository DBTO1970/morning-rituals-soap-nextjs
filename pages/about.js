            <h2>Handcrafted with Simple Ingredients</h2>
            <p>We craft our soap in a variety of coffee shop scents and other pleasing fragrances. Coffee soap used in the shower may help to reduce the appearance of cellulite, redness, acne and dark circles. It&apos;s also great in the kitchen to remove food odors and for use after gardening.</p>
